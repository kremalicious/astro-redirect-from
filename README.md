## Prerequisites

The plugin is designed to work without configuration, especially if your project aligns with Astro's default settings.

- Astro v3+ (v2 probably works too, but is not tested)
- Markdown files should be in a directory (default is `src/pages/`)
- Slugs are extracted either from the frontmatter or the file/folder path

## Installation

```bash
cd yourproject/

npx astro add astro-redirect-from
```

If installing manually:

```bash
npm i astro-redirect-from
```

Then load the plugin in your Astro config file, making sure this plugin comes before any other integrations which make use of the `redirects` config:

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import redirectFrom from 'astro-redirect-from'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    // make sure this is listed BEFORE any hosting integration
    redirectFrom()
  ]
  // ...
)}
```

That's it. Your redirects will be automatically added the next time you run `astro dev` or `astro build`. If any of them have a `redirect_from` field, that is.

For easy debugging, a `redirect_from.json` is written out into Astro's `cacheDir` setting, which by default is under `node_modules/.astro`.

[See Usage](#usage)

### Options

All options are optional and can be passed in Astro's config file:

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import redirectFrom from 'astro-redirect-from'
import { getMySlug } from './your-slug-function'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    redirectFrom({
      contentDir: './content',
      getSlug: getMySlug
    })
  ]
  // ...
)}
```

#### `contentDir: string`

_Default: `src/pages/`_

Specify a different directory for your Markdown files, relative to the project root.

#### `getSlug: (filePath: string) => string`

_Default: `getSlugFromFilePath()`, see below_

If you need a custom slug structure, pass a function to construct your slug from the file path. The file path should be relative to the content directory.

If you use a `slug` field in your frontmatter, this will be preferred by the plugin and passing any `getSlug` function will have no effect in that case.

The default function is a great starting point:

```typescript
function getSlugFromFilePath(filePath: string) {
  const parsedPath = path.parse(filePath)
  let slug

  // construct slug as full path from either:
  // - folder name if file name is index.md, or
  // - file name
  if (parsedPath.base === 'index.md' || parsedPath.base === 'index.mdx') {
    slug = `${parsedPath.dir}`
  } else {
    slug = `${parsedPath.dir}/${parsedPath.name}`
  }

  return slug
}
```

## Usage

In your Markdown file's frontmatter, use the key `redirect_from` followed by a list.

```yaml
---
redirect_from:
  - /old-url-1
  - /old-url-2
  - /old-url-3.html
---
```

Alternatively, you can use a string instead of a list for a single redirect:

```yaml
redirect_from: /old-url
```

## Plugin Development

```bash
npm i
npm start

# production build
npm run build

# publishing to npm & GitHub releases
# uses https://github.com/webpro/release-it
npm run release
```

### Testing

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
# runs unit tests through vitest
npm run test:unit

# all of the above commands together
npm test
```

If linting errors are encountered, try to fix it automatically with:

```bash
npm run format
```
